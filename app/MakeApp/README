MakeApp
=======

A template used to configure a new application that runs on Linux using the
Mali OpenGL ES Emulator and on Android devices in Eclipse. The makeapp.sh
script will update the directories and files in the included template to use
the application and domain name specified on the command line.

Individual applications share the external libraries in <ToT>/ext and
<ToT>/lib including the ARM Mali OpenGL-ES emulator and the ILM math
libraries, which include a nice set of vector and matrix template types
and algorithms.

Note that we use OpenGL ES 2.0, so this code will not run on the Android
SDK emulator, which only supports ES 1.x.


To create a new application:

1. cd <ToT>/app
2. MakeApp/makeapp.sh MyApp mydomain
3. Follow machine and IDE configuration instructions in <ToT>/README
